## Project Ideas for Metis Dapp

### DeFi

DF001: Create an application that uses our Tribes module to delegate where money should be distributed amongst a community (DAO). Members can open the app, navigate to this module, and use our module to display different categories for them to choose from. They can make their decision by joining a particular tribe. Members can also choose to leave that tribe and join another if they change their mind.
Smart Modules: Tribes (Metis)
DappStarter: Asset Tooling

### GameFi

GF001: Create factions/groups (mage, alchemist, swordsman, etc.) within your own personal game for users to join. Our Tribes module allows you to customize your own groups within your game.
Smart Modules: Tribes (Metis)
DappStarter: Create Factions

### DAO

DA001: Build sub-communities within the DAO youâ€™re starting or an active member in. With our Tribes module you can develop different groups and distribute different roles and responsibilities within them for a more optimized workflow. You can even get creative and add personalized art that represents your creators, developers, admins or any other figure within these working groups!
Smart Modules: Tribes (Metis)
DappStarter: DAO Roles & Responsibilities

DA002: Airdops - everyone loves them! Surprise the members of your community with a unique token created and designed by yourself or someone else. What exactly this token represents is up to you, but that's what make it fun.
Smart Modules: Token (Metis)
DappStarter: Token for your Thoughts

DA002: Instead of airdropping tokens you can choose another route and distribute them when members complete delegated tasks. You can then choose how these tokens can be spent (whether they can be redeemed for something else or count as votes that can be cast).
Smart Modules: Token (Metis)
DappStarter: Earn your Tokens

### NFTs

NF001: Have you ever wanted to create your own NFT marketplace where you can create and mint your tokens? Maybe you are even a part of a DAO that wants to create a token ecosystem within it where community members can be rewarded for their achievements and/or contributions. Or you can create NFTs to represent anything else of your choosing!
Smart Modules: Token (Metis)
DappStarter: Token Marketplace

# @astrogenius's Project idea:

## 1. Survey App 

A survey app that aggregates responses and suggests a group to join based on the responses. This will use the *Tribes Module* Each group or tribe would have it's own forum or chat exclusively for group members. 

### Foskaay's dApp Ideas 1

Chat groups for developers - classified into experience levels to ensure they join groups that meet the skill levels needed!
Smart Modules: Tribes (Metis)

### Foskaay's dApp Ideas 2

Crypto token generator - where users have access to easy frontend interface to crate crypto tokens on Metis in a few button clicks without coding!
